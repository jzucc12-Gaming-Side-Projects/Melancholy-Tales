  text: Overall nothing too crazy happened during this time. When I look back, I
    think of this time period as "The Good Ol' Days." When things were simple and
    I was living a bit of a relaxed life. How I really do miss it...

  text: The size upgrade to my ship was a life-saver as well. Having a bit more space
    at my disposal really gave me room to take some bigger jobs. It also made the
    small jobs that much easier for me.

  text: After a few more months on the job, I really hit my stride. Things such as,
    "will I be able to eat tonight", were no longer on my mind. Instead I was thinking
    about how I was going to complete my next job. That was a change of pace I certainly
    needed.
