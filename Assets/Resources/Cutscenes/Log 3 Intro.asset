    of a problem for The Gov. The Res took over trade ships with supplies for The
    Gov military and just flew them off course. With so many trade ships like this
    being automated, they faced little to no in-person resistance. Those encountered
    were simply bound.

    small getaway ships they had ready and darted off into the unknown. The Gov was
    in an uproar as it led to supplies being really behind.

    take too kindly to this and formed a resistance, or The Res, as many called them. '

  text: Security checkpoints started going up all over because of this development.
    It made life less convenient but didn't stop anything really. I kept on doing
    my job and The Res kept on screwing with The Gov. While I did obviously get through
    it, it was quite scary at the moment. I thought my way of life was coming to
    an end.
