  text: I met my dear friend, <b><color=#33B2FF>BF</b></color>. I bumped into them
    by chance at a few different launch stations. Similar to me, they travel for
    their job a lot, but they aren't a smuggler. When asked about what I do, I blurted
    out the first thing that came to mind and said I sold retro fountain pens...

  text: Tensions between The Gov and The Res continued to rise with The Gov getting
    even more creative in their attempts to stop The Res. Despite this craziness,
    something fantastic happened. Something that made all the crap in my life feel
    like it led to something nice.

  text: It seemed like a good idea at the time, but yeah... It wasn't. They figured
    me out pretty fast but were surprisingly understanding when they learned the
    truth. <b><color=#33B2FF>BF</b></color> still teases me by saying a smuggler
    should probably be a better liar! They aren't wrong.

  text: It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship though. We would talk over
    comms and would meet up at stations when we happened to be in the same area.
    Though the conflict between The Gov and The Res would pose bigger threats, I
    actually felt happy for the first time in a while.
