  text: During this break was when  <b><color=#33B2FF>BF</b></color> and I became
    really close. It didn't matter what we did; the two of us just enjoyed each other's
    company. We were there for each other through both thick and thin. <b><color=#33B2FF>BF</b></color>
    was truly my partner in crime... Metaphorically, not literally... I realize now
    how that could be confusing.

  text: It was around this time I thought things were going beyond being nice. I
    thought I was reaching a new normal where I could live out the rest of my days
    in joy. I was wrong however. More wrong than I could imagine. Things were about
    to take a turn and lead me to where I am now...

  text: The next few months were a bit of a needed break. I slowed down with jobs
    because I felt a bit overwhelmed. <b><color=#33B2FF>BF</b></color> and I would
    meet up as well which made the whole experience even better! It was actually
    their idea for me to take the break in the first place.
