  text: The conflict between The Gov and The Res eventually became harder to ignore.
    Dangerous people who were on the top of The Gov's wanted list started escaping
    prison all at once, but The Gov was mostly ignoring them. "Coincidentally" these
    Renegades as <b><color=#33B2FF>BF</b></color> calls them also had a bone to pick
    with The Res.

  text: The Res wasn't just going to take this. Neither were the civilians though
    if I'm being honest. There were still bounty hunters out there taking them down,
    as many of these people did have rewards on their heads. The Gov was just not
    going to get personally involved.

  text: <b><color=#33B2FF>BF</b></color> was very worried about me. They thought
    one of the Renegades was going to falsely claim I was with The Res and take me
    out for a reward. It wasn't completely out of the realm of possibility as they
    did do that sometimes. But hey, it made life more interesting... Silver linings,
    right?
