  text: Many members of The Res were fed up with The Gov and formed a splinter cell,
    Second Sect. They were violent from the start but got worse over time. Initially,
    they were being "generous" and quickly taking out all crew aboard the ships they
    hijacked. Over time, they decided to start taking their time on the crew.

  text: <b><color=#33B2FF>BF</b></color> and I were also getting more worried about
    what could happen to me. I avoided Second Sect best I could, but things don't
    always go as you want. I didn't want to be labelled an accomplice or even worse,
    a member...  I was scared, but now I'm angry...

  text: They proclaimed that if The Gov didn't stand down that things would only
    get worse. I can't tell if The Gov was calling their bluff or if they simply
    refused to back down. Either way, Second Sect wasn't bluffing.
