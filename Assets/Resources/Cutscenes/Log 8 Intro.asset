  text: Second Sect kept to their word and became more aggressive. I still remember
    hearing about the first report of the trade ship they blew up. And then the second...
    And the third... Eventually it wasn't surprising anymore. I remember the sinking
    feeling within me because I likely transported some of these people.

  text: I needed enough in my pocket though to ensure I never wound up in a place
    like this again. <b><color=#33B2FF>BF</b></color> helped me plan to get out as
    quickly as possible and ensure I don't repeat past mistakes when I'm finally
    done. I couldn't go back to that point. I refused. Not again...

  text: I didn't want to and tried hard not to help them. When there's a gun to your
    head and threat of even worse consequences for saying no, you do what you have
    to do. It was at this point I knew I had to get out of this game. I had to quit.
    I needed a better life.
