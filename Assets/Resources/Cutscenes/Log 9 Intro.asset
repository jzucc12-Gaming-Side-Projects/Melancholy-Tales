  text: I was shot at a few times and was even near a civilian vessel when Second
    Sect boarded once. If I didn't wake up late that day, I would have been on board
    when they struck. It ended with The Gov sending troops in and a massive body
    count. Bodys from The Gov, Second Sect, and even some civilians.

    was for me to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I stubbornly refused because
    I was so absorbed in wanting to feel secure after quitting. '

    more jobs and be done with it. I knew jobs were currently dangerous because what
    wasn't anymore, but I underestimated the severity of the situation.

  text: Not only did getting jobs become hard, but getting people to pay out became
    hard too. A client can't pay you when they get arrested for conspiring with Second
    Sect. I began vetting clients as a result. I knew that was the right decision
    when Second Sect began attacking civilian ships. I wasn't helping that happen.
