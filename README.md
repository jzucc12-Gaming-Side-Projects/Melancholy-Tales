<h2>Summary</h2>
This is a solo project where I am working on all aspects of the programming, game/puzzle design, and the story. I focused on learning Unity's new input system as well as improving my process for planning code architecture. I also worked on improving how I plan, document, and track a project's progress.

Melancholy Tales of a Low Orbit Smuggler is a puzzle game based on a riddle called Chicken Crossing. In the game, you play as a smuggler recounting their career through a series of recordings found on the smuggler's wrecked ship. Each stage is a past job in the smuggler's life where you must transport all of the cargo from a planet to a space station. You must be careful when transporting cargo however. Leaving certain items alone will cause you to lose cargo and fail the delivery.

<p>⮞ Created 52 stages that progressively introduce mechanics that build off of one another.</p>
<p>⮞ Utilized Unity’s new Input system to facilitate input management and the addition of controller support.</p>
<p>⮞ Implemented the Observer Pattern to perform various checks and events related to the puzzles.</p>

<h2>New Repository Update</h2>
<p>This project came from a previous repository that contained 3rd party assets. Most art, music, and sfx files have now been witheld from the repository for redistribution purposes as has the dialogue system. The following shader package is required to run the project properly. The dialogue system in the game is based off of a system provided by GameDev.tv.</p>
